## 11. Random Numbers, Simulations, and Shiny Apps

- :card_index: __Dates__: Apr 09-13
- :paperclip: __Topics__: Random numbers have many applications in science and computer programming, especially when there are significant uncertainties in a phenomenon of interest. In this part of the course we'll look at some basic problems involving working with random numbers and creating simulations.

In order to better visualize the results of some simulations, we will briefly discuss Shiny apps. This type of apps are a nice companion to R, making it quick and simple to deliver interactive analysis and graphics on any web browser. We'll review how to create simple shiny apps to display data summaries, queries, and interactive displays.
